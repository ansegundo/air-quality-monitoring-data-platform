# Air Quality Monitoring Data Platform

A data platform for aggregating and visualizing air quality metrics from multiple sources.  
Built to explore patterns in air pollution data and make it accessible for analysis.

## Why This Project?

This project was created to combine data engineering, API integration, and visualization while working with real-world environmental data. Air quality data is fragmented across different sources and formats, and this platform aims to centralize it and make it easier to work with.

There is also anecdotal evidence that professional CS2 player Zywoo (Team Vitality) performs worse in highly polluted cities, which motivated an exploratory analysis using air quality data.

## Current Status

- Setting up the foundation (air quality APIs, tech stack, MVP data pipeline)

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Python  
- Data Storage: SQLite (may scale to PostgreSQL)  
- Visualization: TBD  

## Setup

Nothing to see right now. This section will be updated as the project evolves.
